Octopus Sensing Monitoring
==========================

A web-based real-time monitoring for [Octopus Sensing](https://octopus-sensing.nastaran-saffar.me/). You can
monitor your data from any machine in the same network.

Installation
------------

It required Python 3.7 or later. And it needs to be installed on the same machine where `Octopus
Sensing` is running.

You can use `pip` to install it:

```
pip install octopus-sensing-monitoring
```

Then simply run it by invoking `octopus-sensing-monitoring` from the command line.

You can also use one of the Python package managers like [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to prevent package conflict.

```
pipenv install octopus-sensing-monitoring
pipenv run octopus-sensing-monitoring
```

The monitoring will listen on `8080` port. Open a web page and point to the machine's IP. For
example, in the same machine, open http://localhost:8080 . Or replace `localhost` with the machine's
IP and open it from any other machine.

Testing with fake data
----------------------

For testing purposes, you can ask the server to generate fake data instead of fetching data from
`Octopus Sensing`. To do so, add `--fake` flag when running the script:

```
octopus-sensing-monitoring --fake
```

Naming your devices
-------------------

In `Octopus Sensing`, when you're creating instance of devices, you need to provide a `name`. At the
moment, device names are hard coded in this monitoring app. So you need to use these names for your
devices in order for them to appear on the web page.

* For OpenBCIStreaming use `eeg` (i.e. `OpenBCIStreaming(name="eeg", ...)` )
* For Shimmer3Streaming use `shimmer`
* For the webcam, you need to create instance of `MonitoredWebcam` and name it `webcam`

Security notice
---------------

Note that the web server accepts requests from any machine, and it uses `http` protocol which
is not encrypted. Don't run it on a network that you don't trust.
